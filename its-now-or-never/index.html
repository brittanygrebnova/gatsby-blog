This piqued my interest. No computer science degree, no previous tech experience, and the guy is working in a high level tech firm developing iOS applications. Well, fast forward three years and one more baby later and the idea of becoming a web developer was swept under the rug until very recently. After my second baby was born, I knew for sure that I couldn't see myself returning to my customer service work-from-home position. I knew that I wanted to learn a valuable skill that would help me launch a new career. Web development was again on the table. I started to wish that I had went for it those few years back, and resolved that if I felt that way about it, I wouldn't make the same mistake of delaying this opportunity again. I started researching 'best online coding schools' and 'can you become a web developer without a computer science degree?'. I came upon Flatiron school and read as much as I could about their curriculum, job placement statistics, and general reputation in the community. Something inside clicked and I knew this was the school that I would attend to learn coding. Trying to find the time to study, and really let things sink in, has been a great challenge so far. It feels like a positive challenge, though, and one that will prove its worth in a short while. I'm so glad I decided to start learning web development and I so much look forward to the changes that are in store.</p>
