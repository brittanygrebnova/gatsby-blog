<p>My Sinatra portfolio project is nearing completion. My app is called B-Day Book, and it allows a user to log in and compile a collection of their birthday reminders by person and date. I hate missing someone's birthday and it happens quite often, so I thought this would be useful for other moms like me and anyone else trying to juggle 187 daily tasks. After a good bit of tinkering, all models, routes, and views behave as expected and what a relief. Writing the code for this project was not as challenging as finding the time to sit and do it, but that's a discussion for another day.</p>
<p>I'd like to use this opportunity to talk about some of the challenges that I did face and the concepts that I learned in debugging the errors that came up.</p>
<p>First, the session_secret! I found out the hard way that it's not until you do this:</p>
<pre><code>set :session_secret, "some_cool_phrase"
</code></pre>
<p>that the session<em>id is created and can be assigned to the current user's id for the duration of the time they are logged in. Until I realized that this line was missing, the session</em>id changed at each redirect and I was getting a NoMethodError in the server. I didn't realize how important that step was until adding it made my whole program run correctly.</p>
<p>Next challenge was figuring out how to express the date attribute of the birthday. I decided to use SQL's date format over a string so that eventually I can add the functionality of displaying the upcoming week's birthday reminders. I haven't been able to figure that out yet but I plan to tackle it during the refactoring process. Something along the lines of, 'if @birthday.date is within Date.today + 7, display in a section called 'this week's birthday reminders'.</p>
<p>I originally ran into trouble when I was using "text" as the input type in the form for adding a new birthday. When I found out I could do this:</p>
<pre><code>&#x3C;input type='date' name='date' placeholder='Date'>&#x3C;/input>
</code></pre>
<p>I was finally able to get each of my birthday.date's to display properly. It also added a cute little calendar drop down to the form which looks really nice. I also utilized the type='password' for the login and signup forms. I like how these different input types utilize different formats and make the views look better.</p>
<p>The current challenge that I'm facing, and I don't know if I'll figure it out before my assessment or not, is getting the birthdays to display in chronological order. This sounds like a simple goal and it probably would be for another programmer, but I haven't figured it out yet. The reason is that the birthday.date's are converted from this format that comes in from the form '2013-09-25' to this format when displayed in a list 'September 25'. In order to list chronologically, I have figured that using Ruby's yday method would be a great chronological comparison, meaning the day of the year, but then I would need to create a method that compares the dates by day of the year but displays them in the month name and day format, 'September 25' for example. I need to build a method that compares the dates in one format and displays them in another.</p>
<p>I anticipate making a number of improvements to my portfolio project and can't wait to meet with an instructor who can tell me what needs to be added and improved. I believe that this is the most valuable part of these projects and I sincerely welcome the feedback.</p></div><div style="margin-bottom:1rem;font-family:avenir"><a href="/deliver-me-my-rails-portfolio-project">Next</a></div><div style="font-family:avenir"><a href="/class-vs-instance">Prev</a></div></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/sinatra-does-know-this-ditty";window.webpackCompilationHash="2a1c69f830104c895a4f";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-8d153dff7dae67b40194.js"],"component---src-templates-all-tags-index-js":["/component---src-templates-all-tags-index-js-5d496a86f4e374e626b0.js"],"component---src-templates-single-tag-index-js":["/component---src-templates-single-tag-index-js-f911b7c449d0e2eb6a01.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-80e6466eecff93d03c72.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-133d98130c6659e37cb5.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/webpack-runtime-dfd690cde6ca7dc40f56.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-8d153dff7dae67b40194.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-659fcda1255204000857.js" async=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-80e6466eecff93d03c72.js" async=""></script></body></html>
